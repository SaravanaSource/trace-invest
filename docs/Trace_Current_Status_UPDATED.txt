TRACE CURRENT STATUS — UPDATED

18) SAAS / APPLICATION LAYER (NEW)

Frontend:
- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Pages:
  - /dashboard  → Market summary
  - /stocks     → Stock universe list
  - /stocks/[symbol] → Individual stock intelligence

Backend API (FastAPI):
- GET /market/summary
- GET /stocks
- GET /stocks/{symbol}

Purpose:
Expose TRACE intelligence through a user-facing SaaS layer.

Status:
FOUNDATIONAL – working routes, basic rendering, styling in progress.

--------------------------------------------------

19) API SERVICE LAYER

FastAPI backend exposing processed TRACE outputs.

Services:
- Snapshot loader
- Stock snapshot resolver
- Market summary assembler

Design:
API is a thin adapter over deterministic engine outputs.
No business logic duplication.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT TRACE CURRENTLY IS

A deterministic financial intelligence engine with:

- Multi-engine forensic analysis
- Multi-year stability analysis
- Valuation sanity checking
- Composite scoring
- Per-stock historical memory
- Trend awareness
- Rankings & watchlists
- Narrative generation
- API service layer
- Early-stage SaaS UI

TRACE now exists as an ENGINE + API + APPLICATION stack.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT TRACE IS NOT YET

- No authenticated users
- No portfolio tracking
- No alerts
- No real-time price streaming
- UI is not yet production-polished

--------------------------------------------------

CURRENT PHASE

Phase 3 — Productization

Focus:
- SaaS UI foundation
- API hardening
- Schema stabilization
- Frontend-backend contract

Not focusing on new financial logic.

--------------------------------------------------

NEAR TERM PRIORITIES

1) Stabilize API responses
2) Finalize Stock List endpoint
3) Harden Snapshot Loader
4) Improve UI layout system
5) Introduce shared DTO schemas
