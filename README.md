# TRACE MARKETS

TRACE MARKETS is a calm, structured manual for understanding markets.

It focuses on fundamentals, governance, risk, and long-term decision-making —
not predictions, not trading signals, not noise.

This system is designed to help people think clearly about markets,
build conviction slowly, and document decisions over time.
